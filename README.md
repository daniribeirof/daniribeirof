### Hi! My name is Daniela.

I'm a Brazilian data analyst based in Barcelona.

I have a degree in Architecture and Urban Planning and a few years ago, after having the experience of using urban, demographic and real estate market data in some projects, I became very interested in the incredible world of data. I then decided to make a career transition and have been dedicated to data analysis for over two years.

I am now dedicated to improving my knowledge and skills in the data field to help companies extract increasingly valuable and efficient insights through data interpretation and visualization.
